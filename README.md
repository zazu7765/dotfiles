# dotfiles  
Personal dotfiles, updated as I find/make configs I want to transfer over computers or share with friends
## specifics:  
- skhd and yabai are mac twm so yeah  
- kitty is my term  
- nvim is my current editor  

## installation guide:
- `$ stow {folder}` where {folder} is replaced by the config you want to symlink
